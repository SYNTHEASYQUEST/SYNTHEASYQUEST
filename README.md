### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**SYNTHEASYQUEST/SYNTHEASYQUEST** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- ğŸŒ± We are a group of 5 students who decided to start a project about signal processing and virtual reality.
- ğŸ”­ We are currently working on the creation of a game in virtual reality to learn the basics of signal processing.

- ğŸ‘¯ You can check our work on the repository. Before getting started you should read our project report available on the repository, called "Rapport_de_Projet.pdf".

- ğŸ¤” The "GAME" folder contains the game environment in 3D. You have to go in Assets, then GameF1 scene.

- ğŸ’¬ There is the "ClavierVirtuel" folder that you can load in order to open the synthesizer. Select "Assets" then "Synthe3D_Clic.unity".

- ğŸ’¬ Load both "ServeurRaspberry" and "UDPTEST" folders in order to use the server we made. This server is aimed at receiving datas from capacitive sensors collected in a Raspberry.


Enjoy the experience !
